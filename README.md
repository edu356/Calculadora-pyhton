Calculator Program README
Description
This is a simple Python-based calculator program that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additionally, it includes an advanced summation feature where multiple numbers can be added together.

Features
Addition: Adds two numbers.
Subtraction: Subtracts the second number from the first number.
Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers.
Division: Divides the first number by the second number.
Advanced Summation: Adds multiple numbers (user-defined) until a termination condition is met.
Files and Modules
The program relies on the following modules:

sumar.py - Contains the function for adding two numbers.
suma_avanzada.py - Contains the function for performing advanced summation (multiple numbers).
resta.py - Contains the function for subtracting two numbers.
multiplicacion.py - Contains the function for multiplying two numbers.
dividir.py - Contains the function for dividing two numbers.
Make sure that all the module files (sumar.py, suma_avanzada.py, resta.py, multiplicacion.py, dividir.py) are available in the same directory as the main program.

Installation
Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Place the provided .py files (sumar.py, suma_avanzada.py, resta.py, multiplicacion.py, dividir.py) in the same directory.
Run the main program file.
Usage
Operations:
Suma (Addition): Adds two numbers.
Resta (Subtraction): Subtracts the second number from the first.
Multiplicación (Multiplication): Multiplies two numbers.
División (Division): Divides the first number by the second.
Suma avanzada (Advanced Sum): Allows the user to input multiple numbers (until -1 is entered) and calculates their sum.
Example:
bash
Copiar
1. Suma 2. Resta 3. Multiplicacion 4. Division 5. Suma avanzada
Opcion: 1
Primer numero: 10
Segundo numero: 5
Suma:  15
Notes:
Enter -1 during the advanced summation process to stop entering numbers and perform the summation.
The program will continuously prompt the user to select an operation unless option 6 (Exit) is chosen.
Exit Option
To exit the program, simply choose option 6 when prompted for an operation.
